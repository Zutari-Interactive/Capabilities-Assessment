# **Zutari Unity Developer Interview Task** #

Congratulations on making it this far into the interview process. We enjoyed speaking to you in your initial interview and would like to move on to testing some of your skills in the Unity engine.

Before you get started, assess the work required and let us know how long you expect the project to take you. We will expect to see your commit to the repo by this time and date. You have a maximum of 7 days from the day your receive this task.

Please follow these instructions closely:<br>

•	Clone the repo from here<br>
•	Install and initialize Git LFS.<br>
•	Open in the same version of Unity that the repo project was created in<br>
•	Create a new branch from Main, name it your name.<br>
•	Create a commit with comments after completing each step.<br>
•	Push to Github only once all steps are complete<br>
•	Do not merge back into Main.<br>

Tasks:<br>
•	Create two scenes; Main Menu and Level One. <br>
•	In Main Menu scene, add a UI Button that will load in the Level One scene when the button is clicked.<br>
•	Create a script to handle the loading of Level One.<br>
•	In Level One scene, set the camera to ‘orthographic’.<br>
•	Add a cube and set its position so that it is in the middle of the camera view.<br>
•	Write a script that moves the cube with physics (ie using a rigidbody on the cube) up, down, left and right using the WASD keys.<br>
•	The cube should change to a different colour for each direction it goes (eg, blue if moving left, yellow if moving down etc).<br>
•	If the cube reaches the edges of the camera view it should re-appear on the opposite edge of the view (eg, if the cube goes off the left side of the view, it should re-appear on the right side of the screen).<br>
•	Give the player the ability to change the velocity the cube travels at. Use your discretion to implement this, could be UI or keyboard inputs.<br>

If you have any questions please email them to us before you get started.

Good luck!
